I wish to express my sincere thanks to my supervisor, doc. Ing. Tom치코 Vitvar, Ph.D., for the continuous encouragement and advice given while writing this thesis.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my whole family, especially my parents, for raising me up and supporting me during my studies. Additionally, I would like to thank my friends. I would like to point out my friend David Whalan making me lose worries in spoken English and my other friend Ing. Tom치코 Hodek for encouraging in my life decisions.
