\chapter{Data Analysis}
    Analyzing millions of segments is not optimal for an expert analyst. The work of this expert is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, methods that reduce the number of segments and thus the expert's work need to be used to make the analysis manageable for the expert. The output is a list of text segments that contain dark patterns.

    The methods used in this section follow the work of the Princeton researchers. At the same time, the results of this work are again compared with the results of their work.

    The data analysis can be divided into four steps:

    \section{Preprocessing}
        The SQLite database, which has 9.5 million segments, contains many duplicate segments across multiple websites. For example, "Add to Cart" buttons, various unified headings such as "Product Description", and others. Since only the text of the segments is analyzed, only those segments that have unique text across a single domain are selected from the dataset for further processing. Also, all the numbers in the dataset have been replaced with placeholders, thus reducing the dataset even more. 

        The output of this preprocessing is a reduction in the number of segments from ~9.5M segments to ~805K. Thus, this approach led to a 92\% reduction in the number of segments. Again, the results are similar to those of the Princeton researchers who achieved a 90\% reduction.

    \section{Feature processing}
        In order to be able to use clustering in the next step, the texts of the segments must first be transformed into a representation for which the similarities between the segments can be expressed mathematically (hereafter, the document means the internal text of the segment).  For this purpose, the Bag-of-Words model is used here. This model is a type of word embedding that represents a document as a string of the number of occurrences of words from a dictionary of all words used across all documents. 

        However, many words do not have only one base form. Especially in the English language, a single word can have many forms due to inflections such as declension and conjugation. The basis of the Bag-of-Words model is the previously mentioned dictionary. If that dictionary contained all the occurrences of the different forms of words, the dictionary would be unnecessarily large and inefficient. For example, the distances of two very similar documents could be disproportionately large simply by rewriting them in a different tense.

        This mischief can be avoided by stemming, or lemmatisation, where stemming returns the roots of words. Lemmatization produces the basic forms of words (infinitive for verbs and first-person singular for nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals). Lemmatization also considers the context of the word and is, therefore, more accurate\cite{stemming-and-lemmatisation}. On the other hand, it is slower than stemming.

        The Princeton researchers used stemming from the NLTK Python library\cite{nltk}. Still, because both methods (stemming and lemmatisation) depend on the language and because the NLTK library does not support the Czech language, another library had to be chosen.

        Such a library is UDPipe\cite{udpipe} by the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics at Charles University. Also, one of the functionalities of this library is tokenisation in the Czech language, which is needed to split the documents into individual words (also referred to as tokens)\cite{tokenisation}.

        Each document is tokenised during the dictionary creation process, producing a list of tokens for which lemmas are obtained and then added to the dictionary. Also, stop words from the Czech language and punction are filtered out of these lists.

        The vocabulary after all the described steps above had a size of \textbf{~269K} tokens. However, this vocabulary still contained tokens, which did have not enough occurrences in the documents.

        Furthermore, only those that appeared in the documents at least 100 times were selected. There were only 188 such tokens. The Count Vectorizer\cite{count-vectorizer} was used to create the BoW matrix, which counts the number of token occurrences in a document. 

        Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with three retained components on the BoW matrix led to a dimensional reduction which captured 95\% of the variance in the data.

    \section{Clustering}
        The goal of clustering is to group data together. In this case, it means clustering segments into clusters based on similarity. The expert then evaluates the resulting clusters, which makes the expert's job of manual passes easier.

        The clustering method used was HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)\cite{hdbscan}. According to the Princeton researchers, they selected this clustering algorithm because it is robust to noise and, in particular, allows to choose the minimum size of the output clusters.

        In total, HDBSCAN was performed for four different hyperparameter settings. The number of output clusters and the size of the noise cluster was analysed.  The metric used and the minimum cluster size mentioned earlier were the hyperparameters varied. The metrics used were $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ norms, also known as Manhattan and Euclidean distance. The hyperparameter of the minimum cluster sizes selected was 5 and 10 segments, which keep the size of noise small and prevents two or more clusters (that are separatable) from forming only one.

        The analysis showed the number of clusters is significantly lower for the models with a minimum cluster size of 10 segments. Similarly, as for the results from Princeton researchers, the difference between selected metric distances was not very significant for data. As expected, models with a larger minimum cluster size have a larger noise cluster size. However, this noise cluster is slightly less than 50\% larger, while the number of all clusters is twice as small. Therefore, a model with a minimum cluster size of 5 segments was selected using the Manhattan distance as the metric with \textbf{4,248} clusters (one cluster is the noise cluster). The table \ref{table:hyperparameters-hdbscan} summarised the number of clusters and size of noise for the given hyperparameters.

    \section{Analysis of output clusters}
    \label{section:analysis-of-output-clusters}
        The clusters that were obtained in the previous step are manually scanned in two steps.

        In both passes, I put myself in the role of an expert who evaluates what is and what is not a dark pattern. I used the knowledge I gained from writing the Dark patterns section. I also used available literature \cite{dark-patterns-brignull-types}\cite{dark-patterns-colin}\cite{kysar-douglas}\cite{taxonomies-tales}\cite{taxonomies-conti}. In uncertainty, I also used the Internet to find out examples what is and what is not a dark pattern, to keep my decisions even more objective. However, the subjective component could still play a role in the decision making process.

        In the first pass, I selected those clusters for which any segment could manifest a dark pattern. For example, the selected clusters were commonly countdowns, total cart prices, user references, notifications, product options, logins and registrations. Only the text components of the segments were checked, not how the segment actually looks on the page. This pass resulted in the number of clusters being reduced from 4,249 to 477.
        
        In pass two, I investigate these 477 clusters by directly visiting the website where the dark pattern is searched. If the page no longer exists or does not match the segment, then I investigated screenshots that were obtained during the simulated putchase flow instead. I extended this search by manually going through the entire shopping process directly on the web page and manually searching for all dark patterns.
        
        Lastly, this output dataset of found dark patterns is examined and cleaned from duplicities.

    \section{Results}

    At first, it is important to mention the limitations of the analysis and the evaluation.
    
    \subsection*{Limitations}
    As mentioned in the previous chapter, deciding what is still a harmless user interface pattern and what is already a dark pattern is a complex task. It always depends on the subjective opinion of the expert. At the same time, different types of dark patterns affect each customer differently. Several steps were done as described earlier in \nameref{section:analysis-of-output-clusters} in order to make the analysis to be more objective. Also, more experts analysing the clusters would lead only to more objective results.
    
    Another limitation of this work is that it considers only the textual segments on the page and ignores the appearance of these segments. Thus, it cannot find dark patterns in images, for example.
    
    During the analysis, it was also found that some webshops use dark patterns to increase their number of references on Heureka.cz. This behaviour could significantly affect their position in the overall ranking, especially for the lower-ranked webshops, where a small number of references can make a significant change in the rank.
    
    Lastly, not every webpage was a part of the analysis due to simulation of the checkout flow only. Homepage, listings of products, registration page, login page, and payment page were omitted in the flow.
    
    \subsection{Webshops using Dark patterns prevelance}
    
    A total number of 1,419 dark patterns were found on \textbf{1,081} webshops from a total of 10K webshops, which makes 10.81\% of all webshops to contains at least one instance of Dark Pattern. No dark patterns of the Hidden Costs, Corfirmshaming and Hidden Subscription types were found during the manual passes. The found instances of Dark Pattern are divided into categories and types shown in table \ref{table:summary-dark-patterns}.

    \begin{figure}

    \end{figure}
    
    It can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:dp-percentage} that the position in the Heureka's ranking of Czech webshops has a slightly negative correlation to the number of webshops in each bin, using at least one dark pattern. Using a Spearman's $\rho$ to test the monotonicity of a probability of finding a dark pattern on a webshop is considered as statistically dependent on the position in the Heureka's ranking--i.e webshops higher in the ranking are more likely to use dark patterns ($\text{Spearman's }\rho=-0.291$, $\text{p-value}=0.040 < 0.05)$).
    
    Also, a number of instances over the ranking for every defined dark pattern type is shown in figure \ref{fig:dp-types-in-ranking}. The monotonicities of the dark pattern types were not tested because of a low number of instances for some types of dark patterns. However, it can be seen that all of the dark pattern types were used over the whole spectrum of Heureka's ranking, and none type was used only by the top webshops.

    \subsection{Used E-commerce solutions}
    Utilizing the segments gathered from the page segmentation, stored in the SQLite database, it is possible to select webshops that use an e-commerce solution for the Czech market. Usually, the companies providing such solutions include their names in the footer of the websites. The biggest and very frequently used solutions are recommended in multiple articles on the Internet\cite{5nej}\cite{lupacz}\cite{nastrojeproweb}\cite{entuzio}\cite{compari}. By reading these articles, five such solutions were chosen for testing their market share in the top 10K webshops in Heureka's ranking. Table \ref{table:ecommerce-solutions} shows total numbers of webshops using these solutions. Figure \ref{fig:ecommerce-solutions-histograms} shows the distribution of these five e-commerce solutions over Heureka's rank. 
    
    A total number of ~2.37K webshops use one of the defined e-commerce solutions, which is 23.7\% out of all tested webshops. As expected, Shoptet.cz is the most used one with a share of 68\%.

    \subsection{Notifikuj.cz as a third-party dark pattern provider}
    Compared to the English Internet, which has many providers of Dark Patterns as a Social Proof notification\cite{dark-patterns-at-scale}, the Czech Internet has only one such provider. The provider's name is Notifikuj.cz. During the analysis, no other provider was found to be used; even searching the Internet did not lead to discovering any other provider.
    
    Notifikuj.cz provides dark patterns in the form of push notifications on the e-shop website. By analyzing these notifications obtained from the segment database and studying the Notifikuj.cz website, it was found that the provider allows inserting a total of five notification patterns. Four of these notifications are Activity Message dark patterns. The last notification shows ratings and references obtained on Heureka.cz and Zbozi.cz. It should be noted that the displayed ratings and references are accurate and not deceptive. Notifikuj.cz aggregates real data from Heureka.cz and Zbozi.cz, which can be found directly from these sites. Therefore, it is not a type of dark pattern Testimonials of Uncertain Origin.
    
    It was found that 55 webshops use service Notifikuj.cz. As it is expected, more webshops that rank higher use Notifikuj.cz more frequently than lower-ranked webshops. This can be seen in figure\ref{fig:notifikuj-histogram}. However, this claim is not supported by strong evidence because there is simply not enough data.

    \subsection{Frequently used Dark Patterns on Czech Internet}
    During the analysis, three techniques manifesting dark patterns occurred very frequently on the webshops. Their prevalence in the resulting dataset of 1419 dark patterns was examined. It was found that these three dark patterns are represented in the dataset by 894 instances, which makes 63\% of the dataset.

    This section further describes the prevalence of these four dark patterns in the dataset. Examples are shown in figures.
    
    \subsubsection*{Cross-selling}
    The most prevalent is cross-selling, a technique when a webshop recommends additional products to purchase. Webshops often claim that other users have also bought these products or additional products could come in handy. The dataset of dark patterns contains 695 instances of cross-selling.

    These instances are of pattern type "Pressured Selling". It is important to mention that during the analysis, an instance of cross-selling was flagged as manifesting the dark pattern when the instance was pushing to purchase additional products. For example, this was usually done via pop-up windows or by recommending additional products in further steps of the purchase process. Figure \ref{fig:cross-selling}

    \subsubsection*{Free Shipping}
    Many webshops allow free shipping after certain criteria are met. Such a criterion is the price of the purchase. This can affect a customer's judgment of spending more money on products he initially did not want, only to have free shipping (Some webshops even offer gifts for free). In addition, webshops make users very aware of the need to purchase more products to get free shipping. In total, 132 instances of this dark pattern are present in the dataset of dark patterns.

    As the cross-selling above, this is also a type of "Pressured Selling" dark pattern, and both are often used together. Figure \ref{fig:free-shipping} shows an instance of this dark dark pattern.

    \subsubsection*{Heureka's Satisfaction Survey}
    High credibility is very important for webshops\cite{good-reviews}. For Czech webshops, good reviews on the Heureka portal can earn a certain amount of credibility. In addition, if a webshop is involved in the "Approved by Customers "program (which adds even more credibility), the review can be uploaded to the portal only by accessing it via a special link. This link is sent to the customer's e-mail if he/she gives his/her consent. However, this consent is often unconscious, as it manifests the "Trick Questions" dark pattern. In this case, it uses a double negation in the sentence, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:good-reviews}.

The user may think that he is not giving his consent to the webshop for sending satisfaction surveys by not checking the checkbox.
